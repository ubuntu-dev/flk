\ This file is the meta compiler to produce a standalone forth named FLK.
\ It can also be seen as an example how to build a meta compiler,
\ even though there are simpler ones.

\ FLK's and many other's working principle is to create a simulation of the
\ target memory in the data space of the host FORTH (the one, that runs this
\ FORTH-script), fill it with values that make sense for the target system and
\ then save it to a file that can be executed.

\ In FLK the target space is seen as a single piece of memory residing in the
\ RAM of an Intel 386 in 32-bit protected mode. The piece of memory contains
\ both code and data, therefore the CPU has to be programmed to use the
\ so-called flat-memory-mode. This mode has all selectors set to point to the
\ same memory only with different access rights and is used in i.e.
\ DOS-extenders and good OS like Linux.

\ The target space is logically divided into two areas, the code area and the
\ data area. This is done for two reasons: (i) it makes compilation a lot
\ simpler, because no data-forward references have to be used and (ii) it
\ accelerates execution, because the Pentium and above have speed problems
\ when mixing code and data in the same cache line (32 byte). The disadvantage
\ of the need to know the size of both areas before compiling is only a small
\ one.

\ For each word that is created in the target, a word with the same name is
\ created in the host system. 

\ The following comments (i) document the words provided and (ii) guide
\ through the universe of meta compiling.

\ One interesting fact: This meta compiler is intended to be run by any
\ ANS-Forth system. Therefore it is meant to be an ANS-Forth compatible
\ program.

\ At first we tell the user, what happens.
